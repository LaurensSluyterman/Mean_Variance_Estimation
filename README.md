# Mean_Variance_Estimation

This repository contains the code that was used for our paper 'Optimal Training of Mean Variance Estimation Neural Networks'. The experiment_1.py file 
contains the code for the main experiment. neural_networks.py contains the code that trains an MVE network, either with a warm-up or without and with either equal or separate regularization of the variance. The UCI-datasets are publicly available. These specific data sets were obtained from Yarin Gal's github, as well as the 'load_data' function in utils.py.
